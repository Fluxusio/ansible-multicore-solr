Ansible role for installing multicore Apache Solr
===============================================
This playbook is based on a great tutorial written by 2bits.

http://2bits.com/articles/configuring-apache-solr-4x-drupal-password-authentication.html

Thank you!

Provides
--------

* Ansible playbook for running the role
* Support for Drupal's Solr modules (apachesolr/search\_api\_solr)
  - Solr version 4.x (other versions added as needed)
  - Config files are fetched from search\_api\_solr/solr-conf/4.x
* Automatic closest mirror fetching for Solr
* Editable settings including
  - Solr version (default: 4.7.2)
  - System level user name
  - Installation path
  - Configuring core names and types (default/drupal)
* Vagrantfile for testing and development
* Ansible hosts file that points to the Vagrant box


Requires
------------
* Ansible (tested on 1.6)
  - http://docs.ansible.com/intro_installation.html
* Ubuntu (tested on 12.04 LTS)
* Vagrant (tested on 1.5.1) - *optional*
  - https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/getting-started/index.html

Usage - Vagrant
-------------
1. Clone the repository
2. Cd to the cloned folder and run:
```
$ vagrant up
```
3. Run
```
$ ansible-playbook -i hosts main.yml --private-key=~/.vagrant.d/insecure_private_key
```
4. Run
```
$ vagrant ssh
```
5. After ssh session is started run:
```
$ sudo service solr start
```
6. Navigate to _http://192.168.56.107:8983/solr_ with your browser.

Usage - Remote server
---------------------
1. Clone the repository
2. Cd to the cloned folder
3. Edit the *hosts* inventory file to point to your server
   * See http://docs.ansible.com/intro_inventory.html
4. Change the remote_user in the play.yml file
4. Run
```
$ ansible-playbook -i hosts main.yml
```
  - You'll probably need to add _-K_ to the end for prompting the sudo password
  - If you don't use SSH keys for logging in you may need to add other parameters also. Try _-c paramiko_ and _-k_. See all the available options with _ansible-playbook -h_.


Settings
---------------------
You can change the settings by editing a default settings file but it's better to  override them. Below I list some places you can do that.

1. At the command line after _ansible-playbook -e_ parameter
   - http://docs.ansible.com/playbooks_variables.html#passing-variables-on-the-command-line
2. In the hosts file
   - http://docs.ansible.com/intro_inventory.html#host-variables
3. In files host\_vars/hostname or group\_vars/groupname
   - You have to create these yourself and use host names or groups in your hosts file
   - http://docs.ansible.com/playbooks_best_practices.html#directory-layout
   - See also the previous link to understand how to name hosts and for host groups

Default settings are stored in roles/jiv\_e.solr/default/main.yml.
